# Linking LASLA corpus - LiLa LemmaBank


This repository contains the triples linking the [LASLA](http://web.philo.ulg.ac.be/lasla/)  corpus to the LiLa LemmaBank.

The  [LASLA Latin corpus](http://web.philo.ulg.ac.be/lasla/textes-latins-traites/) consists of a large amount of texts of Classical Latin,  semi-automatically lemmatized and annotated with morphosyntactical information, with full manual verification. The Laboratory is part of the Université de Liège and is currently composed by an [international team](http://web.philo.ulg.ac.be/lasla/membres/).

The linking to the LiLa lemmabank was carried out semi-automatically by a joint team of LiLa and LASLA members (Marco Passarotti, Paolo Ruffolo, Eleonora Litta, Giovanni Moretti for LiLa, Margherita Fantoli for LASLA). Every linking has been manually verified.

Source: LASLA texts are available through data-sharing agreements. Editions are based on the available critical editions at the time of the lemmatization but the annotators have modified the texts according to their own editorial decisions.
